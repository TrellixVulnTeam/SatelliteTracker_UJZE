## Orbital Plotter Bug ##

About the program:
Designed to show the positions of satellites over the earth. The program can plot either one satellite or 
multiple at once. The trajectories of these satellites are shown using a pink circular line around the earth.

Summary of the Problem:
When the program loads up, a GUI is shown. On that GUI is the first MayAvi scene - with just the earth in 3D.
Upon selecting or searching for a satellite(s) - its position(s) are shown and the trajectories are plotted.
However after this, the Widget does not seem to update when another satellite is selected.
I suspect this is down to the widget not being refreshed properly, but I can't seem to find a fix.

Modules/Libraries being used:
MayAvi - this is a type of graphing software tailored towards 3D plotting.
Skyfield - this is responsible for calculating the trajectories and positions of satellites
PyQt5 - this is the GUI I am using as according to the mayAvi docs, it is the easiest to build an application with 
mayAvi.
Traits/traitsui - this is made by the same people as mayAvi and is what is used to set/reset traits (e.g. changing the
satellite name etc.), it is also used in order to view the mayAvi visualisation.
