CHANGELOG v0.3.6 to v0.5:

Major UI overhaul (now working):
- Switched to full UI in traitsui
- PyQt is still being used, however it is used as a toolkit for 
  traitsui

Major changes (UI):
- No longer has a bug where the program must be restarted in order to plot another satellite
- The plotting is now done on screen so the user can see:
	- If plotting multiple orbits, each orbit is shown on screen one-by-one
	- The plotting is now animated.
- There are now 3 methods of selecting a satellite or constellation:
	- from a list of all active satellites
	- from a list of featured satellites and constellations
	- from a search bar
- A progress bar has now been added to show the progress of plotting the satellite(s)
- Most errors are now shown through a UI dialogue rather than in console.

Changes to the back-end:
- Some refinement and increased efficiency to sending and getting data from the server.
	- This can still be improved
- Overhaul of updating TLE data still needs to be completed:
	- All TLEs need to be kept up to date
	- This can be done by redownloading all TLEs at set intervals
	- Or by downloading new TLEs from Celestrak
- No change to any of the actual functions involved in plotting data
	- The file 'plotting_module' has been left intact since v0.3.
- Changes to filenames. 
	- 'module_test.py' is now 'plotting_module'
	- 'gui_test.py' is now obselete 
	- The new GUI is in the file 'traitsui_test'
